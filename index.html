            <h2>Why New Zealand?</h2>
            <h3>New Zealand is a land of great contrasts and diversity</h3>
            <p>
              Active volcanoes, spectacular caves, deep glacier lakes, verdant
              valleys, dazzling fjords, long sandy beaches, and the spectacular
              snowcapped peaks of the Southern Alps/Kā Tiritiri o te Moana on
              the South Island—all contribute to New Zealand’s scenic beauty.
              New Zealand also has a unique array of vegetation and animal life,
              much of which developed during the country’s prolonged isolation.
              It is the sole home, for example, of the long-beaked, flightless
              kiwi, the ubiquitous nickname for New Zealanders.

                    <h4>Tongaririo Alpine Crossing</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is heralded as the best one-day trek in New Zealand and is regarded as among the top ten single-day treks in the world. Many who complete the 19.4 km (12 mile) journey will tell you the climbs can be steep and the weather unpredictable, though worth it in every aspect. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Located in the Tongariro National Park - New Zealand's oldest national park and a dual UNESCO World Heritage Site, rich in both cultural identity and dramatic, awe-inspiring natural scenery. Unique landforms, including the volcanic peaks of Ngauruhoe,
                        Tongariro and Ruapehu ensure the Tongariro Alpine Crossing is considered a world-renowned trek.

                    <h4>Mangorei Track to Pouakai Tarns</h4>
                   <p>
                    From the car park, follow the path up to Mangorei Road and walk to the road end. Follow the track signage up a private driveway and into the bush. 
                    
                    The track climbs steadily through regenerating forest, mountain cedar and low alpine scrub to the 16 bunk Pouākai Hut (stays must be booked in advance).
                    
                    This is a good day tramp or you can stay overnight at Pouakai Hut.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    Going on a fine day with no wind is recommended to see the reflection at the tarn.

                    The best times to visit this trail are November through April. You'll need to leave pups at home — dogs aren't allowed on this trail.

                     <p>
                        This track is one of the best day hikes near Mount Cook Village. There is a breathtaking view over the Mueller Glacier, Hooker Lake, and up to Mount Cook at the end of the track. It’s mostly a flat well-maintained walkway (only a few inclines/steps but not technically difficult) crossing three swing bridges. There is a bench and a stone landing at the Muller Lake Lookout and picnic tables along the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Make sure to go on a clear day for the best experience and go early to try to avoid crowds. Bring plenty of water and a hat - there's not much shade along the way.
